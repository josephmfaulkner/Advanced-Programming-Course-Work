STUDENTS: Joseph Faulkner (jofaulkn) and Megan Muir (memuir)
This program was completed using pair programming.        
Partner:  Joseph Faulkner (jofaulkn@ucsc.edu)                     
Partner:  Megan Muir (memuir@ucsc.edu)             
                                                                    
We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work   
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.
                                                                   
Joseph Faulkner spent       3 hours working alone.           
Megan Muir spent            2 hours working alone.           
We spent                    6 hours working together.        
Joseph Faulkner spent       3 hours driving.                 
Megan Muir spent            3 hours driving.                 
                                                                    
Please grade the work submitted by jofaulkn@ucsc.edu        
and not the work submitted by memuir@ucsc.edu.

This assignment was pretty straigtforward. The goal of this
assignment was to get us oriented and aquainted with C++.
