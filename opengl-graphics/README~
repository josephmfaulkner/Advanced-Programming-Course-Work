PROG ASG#4: OPENGL DRAWING PROGRAM

The default Makefile didn't work by default, so I had to make a few
changes in order for the program to compile. 
I copied the rgb.txt file from the directory "/usr/share/X11/" 
into my local working directory. I changed the script mk-colors.perl
to use the file accordingly. Needless to say, DO NOT DELETE IT!
I also had to change line 36 in the Makefile from:
	mk-colors.perl >colors.cppgen
to: 
	perl mk-colors.perl >colors.cppgen   
With those changes made, the program successfully compiles and runs.
