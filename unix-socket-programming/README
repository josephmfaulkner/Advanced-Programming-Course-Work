ASG5: UNIX SOCKET PROGRAMMING

I ran and tested the code for bugs and errors. 
The only stange thing I found is that it's actually
possible to delete the server (cixd) executable from 
the client. The program stil works even if you do this. 
I thought that this sort of behavior was fishy, so I decided
it was best to add conditional statements to the program in 
order to prohibit removing the cix and cixd files.
